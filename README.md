# GeoLocation Accelerator

This is a simple project to enable location-based queries in Dynamics 365 and powerapps.

## Planned Features for version 1.0

- A few simple Dynamics tables that define locations and regions using gps coordinates.
- A Cosmos Db that enables geospatial queries.
- A layer of Azure functions that sits between Dynamics and Cosmos Db.
- Also there will be either a plugin or javascript functions (or both) that allows us to interact with the layer in Azure.

## Planned Features for version 1.1

- Graphic visualization of locations and regions on a map.
